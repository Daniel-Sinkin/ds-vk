# Vendored Sources

Third-party code is committed directly under 'external/' so downstream projects
can build 'dans-vk' from a fixed repository commit without submodules or
configure-time downloads. Vulkan itself and shader compiler tooling such as
'glslc' are intentionally not vendored; install those through the Vulkan SDK.

The initial source snapshot was copied from
'/Users/danielsinkin/GitHub_private/SPH-Seminar/dfsph_viewer' on 2026-05-15,
with later additions and cleanup in 'dans-vk'.
