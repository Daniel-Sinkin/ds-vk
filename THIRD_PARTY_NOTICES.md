# Third-Party Notices

'dans-vk' vendors third-party code directly under 'external/' so the framework
can be consumed from a single fixed Git commit. Exact upstream URLs, tags, and
commits are recorded in 'external/versions.md'.

The vendored trees are intentionally shortened copies. The removed material is
limited to non-runtime material such as tests, examples, generated docs, CI
metadata, IDE project files, and unused helper backends. Core source, public
headers, build integration needed by 'dans-vk', and license notices are kept.

Vulkan SDK components, Vulkan loader/headers/libraries, and 'glslc' are not
vendored. They are toolchain/system dependencies.

- Dear ImGui was shortened to the core sources and the SDL3/Vulkan backends.
- SDL was shortened to the source, public headers, CMake files, Wayland
  protocol data, and license/project metadata needed for the CMake build.
- GLM was shortened to headers, CMake integration, readme, and license.
- Vulkan Memory Allocator was shortened to 'vk_mem_alloc.h' plus its license.
- nlohmann/json was shortened to the single-header distribution plus its
  license.
- stb was shortened to 'stb_image.h', 'stb_image_write.h', and
  'stb_truetype.h'.
- Inter was shortened to a single 'Inter-Regular.ttf' weight plus the
